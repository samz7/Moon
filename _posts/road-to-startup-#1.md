If you have a good enough internet connection you should see a picture of two fellas on the top of this page. These people are responsible for a tool that helps the mass store their digital belongings in the cloud.

They called it DropBox. Drew (right) got the idea of DropBox when he forgot to bring his USB stick with him. Clearly there should be a better way of storing files, by storing files in the cloud he won't be needing that USB stick anymore. Wait a minute..... if I'm facing this problem everyone else must be facing the same problem, why not build a tool that helps me AND others to solve it? Drew thought.

Identifying a need is the first step. A need that is both **intense** and **frequent**. For DropBox it was the need to store files and gaining access to them on the go. 

This blog series will be a documentation of my startup journey. I have no clue what problem I'm going to solve, what I'm going to build. I don't have money nor do I have great programming skills. BUT I do have a roof over my head, food in my belly and an internet connection, and that should be enough.

Even though I have no idea what problem I'm going to solve I know it should be something that drives me immensely. Something I'm extremely passionate about.

As for the product that will solve the problem. The product should have the following traits.

* It has to be something that people LOVE
* Something innovative (takes a creative approach in solving the problem)
* Need for the product should be intense and frequent.
